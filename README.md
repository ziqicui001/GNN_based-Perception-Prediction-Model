## Introduction

SyncPerception (SP) is a Grasshopper plugin for Grasshopper based on GNN model training. It can predict citizens' perception scores in six dimensions of beauty, safety, vitality, affluence, boredom, and depression in real time, simulating human visual perception of urban scenes. It proposes a dynamic method to incorporate citizens' perspectives into urban planning, providing a practical solution for promoting inclusive and people-oriented urban development.
